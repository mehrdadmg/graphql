Resources for End-to-End typing with GraphQL and TypeScript

## Notes

There is something informally called the "keying-in" operator that is very handy for accessing generated TypeScript types from your GraphQL schema.

```ts
// generated typescript response from schema
type APIResponse = {
  user: {
    userId: string
    friendList: {
      count: number
    }
  }
}
you need to the type of APIResponse.user.friendList but don't know it upfront
type FriendList = APIResponse['user']['friendList']
```

It looks kinda obvious but can be really handy.
